# These should be as close as possible to the settings we use in production.
# As in prod, we read in environment and auth variables from JSON files.
# Unlike in prod, we use the JSON files stored in this repo.
# This is a convenience for ensuring (a) that we can consistently find the files
# and (b) that the files are the same in Jenkins as in local dev.
